[Etra] (TerrasNaxium)
========================

A card game with no random effects sprinkled with simultaneous turns so that no person gets the advantage and the game is 100% skill.

Introduction
------------
The idea of [Etra] was created in the beginning of Winter 2015-2016.  To learn more about [Etra], see:

Notice
-------------------
While this game isn't nearly close to being playable, it has undergone many revisions and commits and the hope is to one day create a semi-functioning prototype of this game so that it can be played!
